# ADR 0001: MVP Scope

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Initial MVP should prove repository understanding and safe proposal generation before full autonomous refactoring.

## Decision
Implement two-phase MVP:
1. Analysis + architecture summary.
2. Single low-risk refactor proposal + PR draft.

## Consequences
- Faster iteration and measurable value.
- Limits early blast radius.
